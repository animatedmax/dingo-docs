## <a id="dingo-s3-logs"></a>Dingo S3 logs

Dingo S3 is installed as an application running on your Pivotal Cloud Foundry in the `system` organization.

You can use the `cf logs` command to see recent or incoming logs:

```
cf t -o system -s dingo-s3
cf logs dingo-s3 --recent
cf logs dingo-s3
```

## <a id="dingo-s3-credentials"></a>Dingo S3 credentials

To confirm which AWS credentials are being used, and other internally configured UUIDs, AWS prefixes, secrets, etc, look at the environment variables for the `dingo-s3` application:

```
cf t -o system -s dingo-s3
cf env dingo-s3
```

The output will include something like:

```
User-Provided:
AWS_ACCESS_KEY: XXXX
AWS_SECRET_KEY: YYYY
BUCKET_NAME_PREFIX: dingo-s3
GROUP_NAME_PREFIX: dingo-s3
GROUP_PATH: /dingo-s3/
PLAN_ID: generated-uuid
POLICY_NAME_PREFIX: dingo-s3
SECURITY_USER_NAME: user
SECURITY_USER_PASSWORD: generated-password
SERVICE_ID: generated-uuid
SERVICE_NAME: dingo-s3
USER_NAME_PREFIX: dingo-s3
USER_PATH: /dingo-s3/
```

The secrets/UUIDs are generated by Ops Manager when the Dingo S3 tile was first installed into Pivotal Cloud Foundry.

Click on the "Dingo S3" tile to edit it; then select the "Credentials" tab to see the credentials generated by Ops Manager.

## <a id="amazon-s3-console"></a>Amazon S3 console

With Dingo S3 users/developers/CI systems can autonomously create new Amazon S3 buckets, and their applications can read/write objects to those buckets.

As an administrator you may be requested to help perform Amazon S3 administration tasks.

First, you will want to determine the Amazon S3 bucket name for a developer's Dingo S3 service instance.

Secondly, you will want to log into the AWS Web Console, and find their bucket. You can then use the AWS Web Console to perform tasks

### <a id="determine-bucket-names"></a>Determining bucket names

To help any user you will need to identify which Pivotal Elastic Runtime organization & space they are working within. As an admin you can then target that space:

```
cf target -o users-org -s users-space
```

The user needs to also tell you the service instance name for their Dingo S3 bucket. It will be `users-bucket` in examples below.

To get the list of available service instances:

```
cf services
```

The output will look similar to:

```
Getting services in org users-org / space users-space as admin...
OK

name           service    plan        bound apps          last operation
users-bucket   dingo-s3   essential   users-application   create succeeded
```

You can only discover the Amazon S3 bucket name once the service instance has been bound to at least one application.

You can now use the [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) CLI tool and some advanced use of the `cf curl` subcommand to discover the Amazon S3 bucket name and API credentials.

```
service_instance_name="users-bucket"
space_guid=$(cat ~/.cf/config.json | jq -r ".SpaceFields.Guid")
cf curl $(cf curl /v2/spaces/${space_guid}/service_instances\?q=name:${service_instance_name} | jq -r ".resources[0].entity.service_bindings_url")
```

The output will look similar too:

```json
{
   "total_results": 1,
   "total_pages": 1,
   "prev_url": null,
   "next_url": null,
   "resources": [

         "metadata": {
            "guid": "22870f9b-4619-451d-befc-3f943fb53575",
            "url": "/v2/service_bindings/22870f9b-4619-451d-befc-3f943fb53575",
            "created_at": "2016-02-17T05:31:50Z",
            "updated_at": null
         },

            "app_guid": "b2c3096b-51b3-4eb7-bd05-3d4e29983f9f",
            "service_instance_guid": "5cb4169b-cd93-4fd1-97ec-77a253eeea49",
            "credentials": {
              "bucket": "dingo-s3-5cb4169b-cd93-4fd1-97ec-77a253eeea4X",
              "access_key_id": "AKIAJDKOBK2LGAKJSC6X",
              "secret_access_key": "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",
              "username": "dingo-s3-22870f9b-4619-451d-befc-3f943fb5357X"
            },
            "binding_options": {},
            "gateway_data": null,
            "gateway_name": "",
            "syslog_drain_url": null,
            "app_url": "/v2/apps/b2c3096b-51b3-4eb7-bd05-3d4e29983f9f",
            "service_instance_url": "/v2/service_instances/5cb4169b-cd93-4fd1-97ec-77a253eeea49"
         }
      }
   ]
}
```

In the middle are the service binding credentials:

```json
"credentials": {
   "bucket": "dingo-s3-5cb4169b-cd93-4fd1-97ec-77a253eeea4X",
   "access_key_id": "AKIAJDKOBK2LGAKJSC6X",
   "secret_access_key": "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",
   "username": "dingo-s3-22870f9b-4619-451d-befc-3f943fb5357X"
},
```

The `bucket` value is the globally unique Amazon S3 bucket name (`dingo-s3-5cb4169b-cd93-4fd1-97ec-77a253eeea4X` in this example).
